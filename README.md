# True Third Person

This mod aims to provide a different way to play Vintage Story by improving the experience of 
the third person camera enough that it provides a similar experience to other games like 
No Man's Sky (Camera wise at least).


# About True Third Person
True third person is not only highly inspired but also builds upon the work done by [Immersive Third Person Camera](https://github.com/LeandroTheDev/immersive_tps_camera/).
If you just want a simpler solution to have a more immersive experience playing Vintage Story i 
suggest you check out his mod [Immersive Third Person Camera | VSModDB](https://mods.vintagestory.at/immersivetpscamera).


# Features

- Ctrl + Scroll Wheel to zoom in and out in third person (Also works with native zoom shortucts)
- Arrow keys to adjust base position of the camera point (Will be deprecated with Left/Right shoulder static position).
- Zoom out and into First Person
- Smooth camera zoom
- Prevent camera zoom in and out on collision with auto adjustment

# Roadmap

- [ ] Configure either Left or Right view points (Remove camera custom positioning)
- [ ] Configure mouse zoom sensitivity
- [ ] Allow camera on a timer to lerp back to original zoom after auto zoom in from collisions
